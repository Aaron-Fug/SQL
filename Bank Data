# For this project, I downloaded Bank Account data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Bank Account data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Creating Table:
CREATE TABLE Carddata(
CLIENTNUM INTEGER NOT NULL,
Attrition_Flag VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Customer_Age INTEGER NOT NULL,
Gender VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Dependent_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
Education_Level VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Marital_Status VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Income_Category VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Card_Category VARCHAR NOT NULL,
Months_on_book INTEGER NOT NULL
)
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#Then I inserted the Bank Card Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

1. How many Customers with an age of 50 or older have an income above $120,000 and attended any type of school.
WITH EduCount AS (
SELECT Education_Level, COUNT(Education_Level) AS 'Education_Count', Income_Category FROM carddata
WHERE Customer_Age >= '50' AND Income_Category LIKE "%+" AND  Education_Level NOT LIKE 'U%'
GROUP BY Education_Level
)

SELECT Education_Level, Income_Category, Education_Count,
SUM(Education_Count) OVER (PARTITION BY Income_Category) AS 'Education_Count_SUM'
FROM EduCount;

SELECT Education_Level, Income_Category, Education_Count,
